# 🤖 AI in the Public Sector: Global Readiness, Governance, and Happiness

## 🎯 Project Overview

This data analysis project investigates the global landscape of **Artificial Intelligence (AI) adoption in the public sector** by addressing a core research question:

**Is the gap in Government AI Readiness between the Global North and Global South statistically significant, and how strongly does this readiness correlate with government quality metrics like Corruption Perception and Citizen Happiness?**

The analysis utilizes data from global indices to measure the relationship between technological maturity and the fundamental elements of good governance.

## 📊 Key Findings

* **Statistically Significant Gap:** A Student's T-Test confirmed a **statistically significant difference** ($P < 0.05$) in AI Readiness Scores between Global North and Global South nations, proving the gap is a real global phenomenon.
* **Governance as a Predictor:** A **strong positive correlation** ($r = 0.85$) was found between the **AI Readiness Score** and the **Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI)**. This indicates that countries with lower perceived corruption and higher transparency are significantly better prepared for public sector AI adoption.
* **Predictive Model:** A **Linear Regression Model** was created using the CPI score as a predictor for AI Readiness, with a significant slope ($\approx 0.59$). This model demonstrates the predictive power of governance quality over technological maturity.
* **The Strategic Factor:** Outlier analysis (e.g., Japan vs. Brazil) showed that while governance is key, **strategic investment and existing infrastructure** can also drive AI readiness, sometimes overriding differences in corruption scores.

## 🛠️ Repository Contents

* `AI_Public_Sector_Project.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing data wrangling (merging, cleaning, standardizing), data visualization, statistical testing (Correlation and T-Test), and the Linear Regression predictive model.
* `WHR24_Data_Figure_2.1.csv`: World Happiness Report 2024 data.
* `CPI2024-Results-and-trends.csv`: Corruption Perceptions Index 2024 data.
* `Proyecto_IA_Global.csv`: The final, merged dataset generated by the Notebook.

## 📑 Data Sources

This project relies on data compiled from three reputable global indices:

| Index | Source Organization | Year/Link | Key Variables |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Government AI Readiness Index** | Oxford Insights | [Government AI Readiness Index 2024](https://www.oxfordinsights.com/ai-readiness-index) | `AI_Readiness_Score` |
| **Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI)** | Transparency International | [2023 Corruption Perceptions Index: Explore the results](https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2023) | `CPI 2024 score` |
| **World Happiness Report (WHR)** | The World Happiness Report | [World Happiness Report 2024](https://worldhappiness.report/) | `Happiness_Score` |

## 💻 How to Run the Project

1.  **Clone the Repository:** `git clone [YOUR REPO LINK]`
2.  **Ensure Data Placement:** Place the downloaded CSV files (`WHR24_Data_Figure_2.1.csv` and `CPI2024-Results-and-trends.csv`) in your project's data directory.
3.  **Install Dependencies:** Ensure you have the required libraries installed:
    `pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scipy scikit-learn`
4.  **Execute:** Open `AI_Public_Sector_Project.ipynb` in Jupyter and run all cells sequentially.
